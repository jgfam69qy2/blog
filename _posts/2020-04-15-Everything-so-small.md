So, this is weird. I am writing in nano in termux in android, and commiting this post with git from here.
I just wanted to see if it can be done, and sure enough, it can!

Now, it works well, it's fast and while I used the pc for some parts, like addkng the new key to github, it was mostly for comfort.

I wonder if I can connect otg cables to usb-c, so that writing with a keyboard can hasten this process...

Also, termux has ssh 8.2 and it supports fido. but i guess using usb is not supported yet, so yubikey authentication is not fully there yet.

this is getting long, will stop for now.

Keep on committing.
