I wanted to write about something, so might as well start talking about what I want to achieve here.

This is basically an experiment to create a static blog while opensourcing as much of it as possible (or using opensource wherever possible). Jekyll and GitHub Pages is the best combo so far, because cheap hosting, and integrates nicely with my general workflow (revision control everything and automate as much as possible).

I have a plan for the following commits:
 - Take a dark theme and create the `page`, `home`, `about` and `post` layouts from the default one.
 - Define a proper About, and post naming/path structure
 - Fiddle with MarkDown to start using static files and hyperlinks whenever possible, to approach a blog with pictures.

This should do it for now. More to come.
