While fiddling with themes I concluded that importing complex and feature rich repos like [jekyll-clean-dark](http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/jekyll-clean-dark/) or [midnight](http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/midnight/) will be a bit of a headache this early in the game. So I did what I know best: Take the default and change shuffle variables around. The result is a simple dark theme, without many weird things happening. Sure some more syntax-highlighting is probably broken, and maybe it's not super pleasing, but it takes the edge of a white background, and that's good enough for now.

If I'm to go on, I'll deffinitely have to get familiar with HTML, CSS, SASS and some other acronyms I'm generally confused about.

How hard can it be?
