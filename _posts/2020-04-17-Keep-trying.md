I've been trying to make a container that created a wifi network and routed all of its traffic through a VPN.. you know... for netflix on android...


Managed to create the wifi.. but it's kinda tricky, and confusing. and sometimes it's easier to make that work just on the bare raspberry, but that means harder dependencies, lower portability and less isolation. Been there, don't want to do it again.

I guess I'll keep reading those docs on docker networking.
