Who am I?

What is this place?

How do I get out of here?

I do tend to ramble on such minor absurdities, and this can well be used as a blog platform to express potentially useful stuff, and eventually learn how to build static websites with useful content...

Other than that, I'm just an administrator with ideas and existential dread that stops me from going full on into deploying them.
